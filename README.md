# SQL Data Analysis Project – Beginner

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates basic SQL concepts used in data analysis.
The goal is to analyze sales data and answer simple business questions
using structured SQL queries.

## Dataset
The dataset contains sales transaction details such as:
- Order ID
- Order date
- Customer name
- Product and category
- Quantity and price
- Sales region

The data is stored in CSV format and imported into a SQLite database.

## Tools Used
- SQLite (for running SQL queries)
- GitHub (for version control and project sharing)

## Project Structure
- `database/` – Contains SQL script for table creation
- `queries/` – Contains SQL queries for data analysis
- `dataset/` – Contains raw sales data in CSV format
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## SQL Concepts Covered
- SELECT statements
- WHERE filtering
- ORDER BY and LIMIT
- Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- GROUP BY and HAVING
- CASE WHEN conditions

## Sample Business Questions Answered
- Which product category generates the highest revenue?
- What is the total and average sales value?
- Which products are high-value vs low-value?
- How does sales vary by category?

## Outcome
This project helped me understand how SQL is used in real-world
data analysis to explore data and generate business insights.
